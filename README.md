# Detection-of-Shapes

- Created a multi-class image classification Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the dataset of 15,000 images which consists of 4 shapes- Triangle, Star, Square, and Circle.

- Image pre-processing, Feature learning, and Classification operations are done. Methods including building Convolutions, Pooling, Flattening layers, and producing fully-connected layers for output.
